__**Who Should Submit?**__

This is a chance to share about that thing you are really good at, just getting started with, or are excited to share experiences about.  Looking for 'The Next Big Thing' takes all kinds, so that means you. Yes YOU. The person reading this.  If you find yourself here and aren't sure if you should submit, that's a definite sign that we want to help you get your start.

Presenters are expected to bring their own devices, although it may be possible to work with those who only are able to bring slide decks. A limited range of adapters may be available, but better to plan to bring your own, just in case.  

The more information you share ahead of time the more we have to base our selections on.  The submission deadline is June 8, 2024.

SWFLSec and Hackation 2024 do not provide honorariums or travel assistance for speakers. We apologize if this impacts your ability to present.
