## Welcome to SWFLSec

SWFLSec (aka DC239, DEF CON Group 239) is Southwest Florida's information security community serving the southwest Florida region consisting of Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte, Glades, Lee, Hendry, and Collier Counties. We meet the third Tuesday of each month at 6:30PM EST unless otherwise notified via our Meetup page.  Currently all tech talk meetups are held virtually. We also have a social meetup each month which is an informal, physical gathering at a local business. We welcome everyone to attend whether working in information security or not.

The mission of this community is to provide a free, vendor-neutral forum for the expansion and dissemination of industry knowledge through presentations, outreach, and other educational activities; to extend the culture of security awareness in the communities we serve; and enable members to make informed, educated security decisions. SWFLSec is a community where the public and anyone who works, plans to work, or provides a service in the information security area, can come to ask questions, seek advice, talk to other professionals, and keep up with the latest ideas and newest technology.
