<h1 id="imposter-syndrome-disclaimer">Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer</h1>
<p>A warm invitation to contribute to SWFLSec, the southwest Florida infosec community.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h3>
<p><em>Imposter syndrome disclaimer</em>: SWFLSec wants your help. No really, it does.</p>
<p>There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts, or have CVE(s) attributed to you before you can attend a SWFLSec meetup, let alone speak at one.</p>
<p>I assure you, that is not the case.</p>

<p>Have an idea, topic, or research you want to talk about? Reach out to the community organizer with your ideas and request some time, it's that easy.
