Name: Sophia Singh

Backstory: Sophia is a brilliant cybersecurity and open source intelligence (OSINT) expert. She has a B.S. in computer science from Innsmouth College and has worked for various government agencies and private companies before starting her own with her good friend Maya Bishop. She is also an avid fan of H.P. Lovecraft's works and has a deep knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos. Sophia's parents were killed in a suspicious accident when she was a teenager, and she was raised by her grandfather, a retired cryptographer. He taught her everything he knew about codes, ciphers, and encryption. Sophia has always suspected foul play in her parent's deaths and has grown up believing there is a secret society based in Innsmouth steering global affairs. Sophia's obsession with the Cthulhu Mythos and her background in cryptography make her the perfect candidate to uncover the secret society.
